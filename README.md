# score-driven-models
Research code for spatio-temporal, multivariate score-driven (GAS/DCS) time-series models with different types of scaling matrices.

# General
Code for building, estimating, and experimenting with score-driven (a.k.a. GAS / DCS) time-series models, with a focus on the effect of different scaling matrices in multivariate settings.

This repository underlies my MSc thesis on **Evaluation of Scaling in Multivariate Score-Driven Filters**, where I compare explicit and implicit filters and study how scaling choices impact stability and forecasting performance.
